# Arduino Tour Guide Robot
ETC 423 Microprocessor Interfacing - Group project

Using a MLT-JR Tracked Development Robot, our goal was tasked to design a 'tour guide' controlled by the Arduino Uno R3 board.  As the only team member with programming experience in C, I became responsible for a developing predefined paths, creating flowcharts, and programming all but one of its functions.  One of three task is chosen to run using push button input, LEDs display current status, and a sonar sensor was used to obstacle avoidance.
