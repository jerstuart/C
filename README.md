# Arduino Tour Guide Robot
ETC 423 Microprocessor Interfacing - Group project

Using a MLT-JR Tracked Development Robot, our goal was tasked to design a 'tour guide' controlled by the Arduino Uno R3 board.  As the only team member with programming experience in C, I became responsible for a developing predefined paths, creating flowcharts, and programming all but one of its functions.  Path selection is performed using push button inputs, LEDs provided robot's status, and a sonar sensor was used for obstacle avoidance.
